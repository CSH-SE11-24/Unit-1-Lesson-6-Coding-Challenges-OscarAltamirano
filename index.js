// MILD
// Create an array called truths and store 3 true facts about yourself
let truths =["I play basketball", " I like reading comics", "In my household their is 7 people"] 

// console log the 1st element (element is not same as index!)
console.log(truths[1])

// change the value of the last element
truths[2] = "I'm 5'6"

// console log the last element to check that it's changed
console.log(truths[2])

// MEDIUM

let lies = ["I'm 5'8", "I'm 16 years old", " I love ELA"]

// delete a value from the lies array
lies.pop("I love ElA")

// console log the second list to confirm the value is gone
console.log(lies)

// add a new lie to the lies array
lies.push["I'm in 10th grade"]
